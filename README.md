Snippets module for ProcessWire
===============================

This module can be used to inject simple (HTML/JS/CSS) snippets into rendered page content. Snippets can be injected before, after, or in place of existing markup tags, and they can be applied to specific pages only by matching pages selected from a list or by matching a selector.

## Requirements

- ProcessWire 3.0.112+
- PHP 7.1+

## Installing

This module is installed just like any other ProcessWire module: copy or clone the directory containing this module to your /site/modules/ directory, log in, go to Admin > Modules, click "Check for new modules", and install "Snippets".

Process Snippets will be automatically installed along with the main module Snippets.

## How to use

When this module is installed, a new Admin page Snippets is automatically added under Settings. This page contains a list of snippets and provides a GUI for managing them. Note that only users with the "snippets" permission will be allowed to view/edit snippets.
